# CSCI 360 Software Architecture, Security, Testing
## Team Stardew
### Overview
A semester group-conducted project to build a software with regards to architecture, security and iterative testing to full-fill the client's request for a program that aligns with such critera: 

The College of Charleston welcomes over 2,000 new students to the community every fall semester. Situated in the heart of historic Charleston, the campus buildings hold significant historical value, which new students are eager to explore. To introduce students
to both the campus and the city, the college plans to launch a scavenger hunt game. This game will be available on portable devices like laptops or, preferably, smartphones. The college must have the ability to design and modify the gameâ€™s storyline and activities.

Students will follow the instructions provided by the game. The game can either be played on a static map of the campus or, ideally, using Augmented Reality (AR) at the actual historical locations on campus. Students will register using their CofC email, to play the
game.
